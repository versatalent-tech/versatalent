# 🚨 URGENT: Fix Your Netlify Deployment NOW

**Your site is showing "Page not found" - here's how to fix it in 10 minutes**

---

## ✅ I've Fixed Your Configuration Files

I've updated:
- ✅ `netlify.toml` - Configured with Essential Next.js plugin
- ✅ `next.config.js` - Removed broken static export
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub - All changes are live

**Now YOU need to do these 3 critical steps in Netlify dashboard:**

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Enable Essential Next.js Plugin (2 minutes)

**This is the MOST IMPORTANT step!**

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com
2. Select your site
3. Click **"Site settings"** (top navigation)
4. In left sidebar: **"Build & deploy"** → **"Build plugins"**
5. Look for **"Essential Next.js Build Plugin"**
6. If it says "Not installed", click **"Install"**
7. If it says "Disabled", click **"Enable"**
8. Click **"Save"**

**Screenshot guide**:
```
Site settings → Build & deploy → Build plugins
→ Essential Next.js Build Plugin → Install/Enable
```

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Verify Build Settings (1 minute)

Still in **Site settings** → **"Build & deploy"** → **"Build settings"**:

Check these match:
- **Build command**: `npm install && npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `.next`
- **Production branch**: `main`

**If they don't match**:
- Click "Edit settings"
- Update them
- Click "Save"

---

## 🔐 Step 3: Set Environment Variables (3 minutes)

Still in **Site settings** → **"Build & deploy"** → **"Environment"**:

Click **"Add a variable"** and add EACH of these:

```bash
DATABASE_URL = your_neon_database_url
SUMUP_API_KEY = sup_sk_...
SUMUP_MERCHANT_CODE = MC0X0ABC
SUMUP_AFFILIATE_KEY = ...
SUMUP_AFFILIATE_APP_ID = ...
ADMIN_USERNAME = admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD = your_secure_password
STAFF_USERNAME = staff
STAFF_PASSWORD = your_secure_password
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL = https://same-i3xfumkpmp9-latest.netlify.app
```

**Critical**: Use your ACTUAL values, especially:
- Real Neon database URL
- Real SumUp keys
- Secure passwords
- Your actual Netlify URL

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Trigger New Deploy (1 minute)

1. Go to **"Deploys"** tab (top navigation)
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"** button (top right)
3. Select **"Deploy site"**
4. Wait 2-5 minutes for build to complete

---

## 👀 Step 5: Watch the Build (2 minutes)

While building, watch the logs. Look for:

✅ **GOOD signs**:
- "Installing dependencies" - ✅
- "Building Next.js application" - ✅
- "Compiled successfully" - ✅
- "Essential Next.js plugin loaded" - ✅
- "Deploy succeeded" - ✅

❌ **BAD signs**:
- "Plugin failed to load" - Plugin not enabled!
- "Missing environment variable" - Add missing vars!
- "Build failed" - Check error message!

---

## ✅ Step 6: Test Your Site (2 minutes)

After deploy succeeds:

1. **Click the site URL** in Netlify dashboard
2. **Expected**: Your homepage loads! (NOT "Page not found")
3. **Test pages**:
   - Homepage: `/` - Should load
   - Talents: `/talents` - Should show talents
   - Events: `/events` - Should show events
   - Admin: `/admin/login` - Should show login form

4. **Open browser console** (F12)
   - Should see NO red errors
   - Should see your site working

---

## 🎉 Success! What You Should See

If everything worked:
- ✅ Site loads at your Netlify URL
- ✅ No "Page not found" error
- ✅ Homepage displays correctly
- ✅ Talents page shows talent cards
- ✅ Admin panel accessible
- ✅ No console errors

**YOU'RE DONE!** Your Next.js 15 app is working on Netlify! 🎊

## ❌ Still Not Working?

### Quick Fixes:

**If plugin won't enable**:
- Try refreshing Netlify dashboard
