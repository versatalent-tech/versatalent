## üîß Technical Details

### **Upload API**

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/upload`

**Request**:
- Method: POST
- Content-Type: multipart/form-data
- Body: File in 'file' field

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "url": "/images/events/event-1730203845-abc123.jpg",
  "filename": "event-1730203845-abc123.jpg"
}
```

**Error Response**:
```json
{
  "error": "File size too large. Maximum size is 5MB."
}
```

### **Validation**

**File Type Check**:
```typescript
const allowedTypes = [
  'image/jpeg',
  'image/jpg',
  'image/png',
  'image/webp',
  'image/gif'
];
```

**Size Check**:
```typescript
const maxSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB
if (file.size > maxSize) {
  throw new Error('File too large');
}
```

### **Storage Structure**

```
public/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ events/
          ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ event-1730203845-abc123.jpg
          ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ event-1730203846-def456.png
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ event-1730203847-ghi789.webp
```

### **Filename Generation**

```typescript
const timestamp = Date.now();
const randomString = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 8);
const extension = file.name.split('.').pop();
const filename = `event-${timestamp}-${randomString}.${extension}`;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Upload Fails**

**Error: "Invalid file type"**
- **Cause**: File format not supported
- **Solution**: Use JPEG, PNG, WebP, or GIF only

- **Solution**: Compress image before uploading
- **Tools**: TinyPNG, ImageOptim, Squoosh

**Error: "Upload failed"**

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

3. Use images from `/public` directory
4. Works for existing images

### **External Images**

Currently not supported:
- ‚ùå Cannot use external URLs (http://, https://)
- ‚ùå Must upload to server
- ‚úÖ Upload once, use multiple times
- ‚úÖ Copy URL to use in multiple events

### **Image Reuse**

To use same image for multiple events:
1. Upload image in first event
2. Note the image URL (e.g., `/images/events/event-123.jpg`)
3. In second event, paste that URL
4. Or upload again (creates duplicate)
