## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### ✅ **Problem 1: Form Name Mismatch** - FIXED
**Issue**: Static HTML forms had different names than React forms
**Solution**: Synchronized all form names to match exactly

### ✅ **Problem 2: Incorrect React Attribute** - FIXED
**Issue**: React form used `netlify` instead of `data-netlify="true"`
**Solution**: Updated to proper React/Next.js attribute

### ✅ **Problem 3: Field Mismatches** - FIXED
**Issue**: Field names didn't match between static HTML and React
**Solution**: All field names now synchronized across both
