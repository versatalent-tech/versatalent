# üìß How to Fix Netlify Forms & Enable Email Notifications

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Forms Don't Work on Localhost!

**Netlify Forms ONLY work on deployed sites.** Testing on `localhost:3000` will never send emails or capture form submissions. You must deploy to Netlify first.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Deploy Your Site to Netlify

Your site needs to be live on Netlify for forms to work. Once deployed, Netlify will automatically detect your forms.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Submit a Test Form

After deployment:

1. Visit your live Netlify site (e.g., `https://your-site.netlify.app`)
2. Go to the `/contact` page
3. Fill out and submit ANY form (contact, talent, or brand)
4. You should see a success message

**This step is crucial** - Netlify only creates form entries in the dashboard AFTER the first submission.

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Set Up Email Notifications in Netlify Dashboard

### 3.1 Access Netlify Dashboard

1. Go to: **https://app.netlify.com**
2. Sign in to your account
3. Select your **VersaTalent** site
4. Click **"Forms"** in the left sidebar

### 3.2 Verify Forms Are Detected

You should see your forms listed:
- `versatalent-contact`
- `versatalent-talent`
- `versatalent-brand`
- `versatalent-newsletter`

If forms are NOT showing:
- Make sure you deployed the site
- Submit a test form on the live site
- Refresh the Forms page

### 3.3 Configure Email Notifications

**For EACH form**, do the following:

1. Click on the form name (e.g., `versatalent-contact`)
2. Go to **"Settings & notifications"** tab
3. Scroll down to **"Form notifications"** section
4. Click **"Add notification"**
5. Select **"Email notification"**

### 3.4 Email Notification Settings

Configure each notification:

**Email to notify:** `versatalent.management@gmail.com`

**Subject line (customize for each form):**
- Contact form: `üîî New Contact Inquiry - VersaTalent`
- Talent form: `üåü New Talent Application - VersaTalent`
- Brand form: `ü§ù New Brand Partnership - VersaTalent`
- Newsletter form: `üìß New Newsletter Signup - VersaTalent`

**Email template:** Leave default or customize

6. Click **"Save"**

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Test Email Notifications

1. Visit your live site: `https://your-site.netlify.app/contact`
2. Fill out a form with test data
3. Submit the form
4. Check your email: **versatalent.management@gmail.com**
5. **Check spam folder** if you don't see it in inbox

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Forms Not Appearing in Netlify Dashboard

**Problem:** No forms showing after deployment

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure `/public/contact-form.html` exists (it does ‚úÖ)
2. Deploy/redeploy the site
3. Submit a test form on the LIVE site
4. Wait 1-2 minutes and refresh Netlify dashboard

### Form Submission Fails

**Problem:** Getting errors when submitting forms

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify you're on the LIVE site (not localhost)
3. Check Network tab to see the POST request
4. Make sure form has `netlify` attribute

### Not Receiving Emails

**Problem:** Forms submit but no emails arrive

**Solutions:**
1. Verify email notifications are configured in Netlify dashboard
2. Check spam/junk folder
3. Verify email address: `versatalent.management@gmail.com`
4. Check Netlify dashboard to confirm submission was captured
5. Wait a few minutes (email can be delayed)

### Emails Going to Spam

**Problem:** Emails arrive in spam folder

**Solutions:**
1. Mark as "Not Spam" in Gmail
2. Add `team@netlify.com` to your contacts
3. Create a Gmail filter to never send Netlify to spam
4. Consider using a custom domain email
